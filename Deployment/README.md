# An aspect of the model was deployed as per the course requirements.

## This consisted of a python code that read in the Net-3 model, accepted a json dict version of an image, converted the image to a target image, and finally, returned that image in json format.

## This was conducted in full-loop on a local server at home.

## The deployment on an AWS server was conducted to the point of : setting up a server, installing miniconda with all the required packages, get the code running. However, communication as a public IP was not established and that final step is not required as per the instructor's guidance.
